# Mid-Term-Project-3D-Object-Detection
This project has several task to be performed, divided as follow:
* Step 1
* Step 2
* Step 3
* step 4
## Step 1
The aim of this step is to extract Lidar data from the image, both range image and intensity channels, stack them together and eventually compute the Lidar point-cloud using Open3D library.
The results of the steps are the following
